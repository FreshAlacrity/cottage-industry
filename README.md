# Cottage Industry
*a cosy Minecraft survival modpack with aesthetic automation, tinkering, and cottage witchcraft*

Welcome to a kinder, gentler kind of Minecraft! Cottage Industry marries the cottage witchcraft of Hexerei with the aesthetic technology of Create and the satisfying tool-customization experience of Tinker's Construct and many other supporting mods to create a softer, more aesthetic survival experience. Right now it's pretty rough around the edges, but the goal is to make a pack suitable for casual survival building and landscaping while maintaining the chewy puzzle of how to automate a wide range of resources. Combat is not prioritized here; instead, the goal is to include more cozy ways to get the same resources for squishy-hearted gamers like myself. 

This is my first public modpack! Please help me out if you see any issues or areas for improvement - I'm definitely still learning.

## What Does Cottage Industry Have?
- curated mods, tested to work together (so far only in singleplayer)
- help to offer (or at least sympathy and issue tracking) if any issues come up
- custom recipes and attention to mod integration and overall progression
- configs that make sense for the pack and help the mods work together

  - More [contact information is available on the Wiki](https://github.com/FreshAlacrity/cottage-industry/wiki/Contact-Information)
- The current version is **just the core mods**
  - No custom advancements are included yet.
  - The recipes included currently are either experimental or basic compatibility and quality of life type things.
  - Expect changes to come!
- There are a few [known issues with mods in the pack (list on the wiki)](https://github.com/FreshAlacrity/cottage-industry/wiki/Known-Issues)
  - Most notably, the Dowsing Rod item from Hexerei will crash the game if thrown or placed into an item frame (this should be fixed in the next update)
- **Server testing** is slated to begin soon!
  - [Get more information on that and how to apply to help test here.](https://github.com/FreshAlacrity/cottage-industry/wiki/Test-Servers)
- Optifine is **not included** and it **may cause the game to crash** if it is added
  - I've tested version 0.0.5 and 0.0.6 with OptiFine HD U H4 and had that work, so if you'd like to try including that [you can get that here](https://www.curseforge.com/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252foptifine.net%252fdownloads). 
  - Optifine is not part of the CurseForge ecosystem, so it can't be included in the official pack.
- The MIT license for the pack only applies to things I've added to the pack - the mods and datapacks themselves are **licensed separately** by their creators
- The datapacks included in the repository should in theory also work on other modpacks which contain the same core mods, those being Hexerei, Create and Create Deco, Tinker's Construct, Supplementaries, Quark and Quark Oddities, Bongo, and Farmer's Delight.
  - If you'd like to fork Cottage Industries and change up the mod list, please feel free!

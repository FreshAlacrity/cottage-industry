FokaStudio's Ender Expansion is included in this folder as a .zip but it's not one I've made! Here's some handy links to learn more about it:

Made by Foka/FokaStudio based on the 1.17.1 Far End pack by Hex (https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/far-end-ender-expansion-datapack-v0-1/)

Planet Minecraft page for the datapack here (has a list of what has changed from the Far End pack):

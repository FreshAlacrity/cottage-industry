## To Do
(see also #todo's)
Add a welcome message on a delay that includes a click-to-warp button
Turn down the ambient light a bit? it looks too bright rn

## General Info
Generation - currently just stone, amethyst geodes and glow lichen should generate
Amethyst geodes are generating very plentifully - should that be changed? #todo

## Quark
Dungeons - blacklist minecraft:asteroid_surface biome and/or mushroom biome types as places to put dungeons, or else it'll stick those in midair in the asteroid dimension

Corundum - can whitelist asteroid:asteroids_dimension in the corundum generation settings

## Create
Not sure how to get Create to not put zinc ores there yet #todo

## Supplementaries
Urns - blacklist `minecraft:asteroid_surface` as a place to put urns (requires restarting the game to take effect if changed in-game)

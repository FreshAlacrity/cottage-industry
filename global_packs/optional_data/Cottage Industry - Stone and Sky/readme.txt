Hello! This is a work-in-progress datapack;

It's designed with the assumption that players start with a superflat world that includes a lot of stone;
recommended world generation settings are:

Allow Cheats: ON (just in case!)

More World Options...

Generate Structures: OFF

World Type: Superflat

Preset:
minecraft:bedrock,230*minecraft:stone;minecraft:windswept_hills
230*minecraft:stone;minecraft:windswept_hills

Potantial Additions:
minecraft:bedrock
minecraft:lava

decoration

The /stoneblock:setup function will also disable trader spawns and pillager patrols etc.
To create the starter cave without affecting game settings, use /stoneblock:make_cave
